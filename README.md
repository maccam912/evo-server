## Overview

This project simulates the evolution of artificial creatures that must learn to survive in a competitive, resource-limited environment. Each creature has:

- **A neural network brain** (16 inputs â†’ 6 hidden neurons â†’ 4 outputs) that controls its behavior
- **A genetic code** (150-byte genome) that encodes the neural network's weights
- **Dual resource systems**: Energy for actions and Health for survival
- **Combat capabilities**: Creatures can attack each other for territory and resources
- **Advanced sensors**: Detect nearby creatures, respond to attacks, monitor health
- **The ability to reproduce**, passing mutated copies of their genome to offspring

Over thousands of generations, natural selection shapes these creatures from random beginnings into complex agents capable of hunting, fleeing, healing, and strategic combat.

### Key Features

- **Combat system**: Creatures can attack, defend, and evolve combat strategies
- **Health and healing**: Separate health pool with energy-based regeneration
- **Food diversity**: Plant food (renewable) and meat food (from deceased creatures)
- **Advanced AI sensors**: 16 sensory inputs including threat detection and health awareness
- Real-time web-based visualization with energy-colored creatures
- Automatic checkpoint/resume system for long-running experiments
- Highly configurable simulation parameters (damage, healing, neural architecture)
- Built with Rust for maximum performance
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Quick Start

### Local Development

**Prerequisites**: Rust 1.70+ and Node.js (optional, for frontend development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd evo-server

# Build and run
cargo build --release
cargo run --release -- --config config.json

# Open browser to http://localhost:8080
```

### Docker (Production)

```bash
# Start the server
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the server
docker-compose down
```

The simulation will:
1. Initialize 100 creatures with random genomes
2. Start the evolution process
3. Save checkpoints every hour
4. Stream real-time updates to the web UI at `http://localhost:8080`

## How It Works

### The Simulation Loop

Every tick (30 times per second by default):

1. **Food regenerates** - Random cells gain food based on regeneration rate
2. **Creatures think** - Each creature's neural network processes sensor inputs
3. **Actions execute** - Creatures move and eat based on neural network decisions
4. **Energy depletes** - All creatures lose energy from metabolism and movement
5. **Reproduction** - Eligible creatures create mutated offspring
6. **Death** - Creatures with zero energy are removed

### Neural Evolution

Creatures start with **completely random brains** - their initial behavior is essentially noise. However:

- Creatures that **accidentally find food** survive longer
- Creatures that **survive longer** have more chances to reproduce
- **Offspring inherit** their parent's genome with small random mutations
- Over generations, **food-finding behaviors** become more common in the population

The result: After thousands of generations, you'll observe creatures actively seeking food, avoiding empty areas, and efficiently managing their energy.

### Energy Economy

The simulation is driven by an energy-based economy:

| Event | Energy Change |
|-------|--------------|
| Per tick | -0.1 |
| Movement | -1.0 |
| Eating food | +20.0 |
| Reproduction | -50.0 |

Creatures must balance exploration (costly movement) with exploitation (staying near food sources).

**Watch evolution in action**: Start the server and observe as random noise transforms into intelligent behavior over hundreds of generations. The best creatures you see today are the descendants of lucky accidents from earlier generations.
